Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, all three model archiectures did not correctly classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg
        Alexnet : Classifier: shetland sheepdog, shetland sheep dog, shetland
        Resnet  : Classifier: collie
        Vgg     : Classifier: collie
        The actual breed of Dog_01.jpg was Australian Shepherd


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures classified the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures correctly classified Frog_01.jpg and Aston_Martin_F1_Car_01.jpg to not be dogs


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Based on the answers for questions 1-3 and the results summary below for each of the models,
        all three models performed identical to each other. All models correctly classified "dogs" and "not-a-dog"
        at 100% accuracy. However, all models failed at correctly classifying the breed of dog therefore all models
        have a 0% accuracy on pct_correct_breed.
        Therefore, there is no one model that performed "best".
